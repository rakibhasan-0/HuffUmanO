This project implements Huffman Coding, a popular lossless data compression algorithm. This repository provides functionalities for both encoding and decoding files using Huffman Coding with the support of a trie and a bitbuffer.
Features:

    Frequency analysis from a given frequency file.
    Encoding of an input file into compressed Huffman coding format.
    Decoding of a compressed Huffman coded file to its original form.
    Display of input and output file sizes upon encoding.



Usage:
Encoding:
To perform frequency analysis on frequence.txt and subsequently encode the file infil.txt, storing the result in utfil.kodad: ![image](https://github.com/rakibhasan-0/Huffman-/assets/15912059/c8f0dba7-a126-4875-b587-f7bf8f380486)



Decoding:

To decode the Huffman coded file infil.kodad using the frequency details in frequence.txt and save the result in utfil.txt:
